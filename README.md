Qt is a very lightweight and dynamic tool and can be used on most platforms to build applications. So, what I have built are simple apps with it. They are actually a lot of fun to build and a good way to revise OOP concepts in C++. They are designed with [Qt_Creator(4,15,1)](https://www.qt.io/download)

## Description of files:
* **A simple notepad application**: With functionalities like cut, copy, paste, opening new files, saving new files etc.
